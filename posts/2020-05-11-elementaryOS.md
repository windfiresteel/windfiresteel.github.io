title: elementary OS is alright
---

I've actually tried out elementary many times and it's an okay linux distro. If you don't mind the design the team is going for with the applications made specifically for it. elementary OS does make it easy to install software that isn't made specifically for it, but warns you that they have no control over the updates. It's also the only distro that allows you to purchase software in the app store. There are some problems I have with it like apps lacking in features. elementary OS also doesn't allow you to change the theme or color of applications in any way, which is why I'm no longer using it. They are working on a dark theme and colorful accents, so I may check in on that when it's released. I haven't exactly explained that elementary OS is very visually like MacOS and I was a big fan of MacOS, but don't expect it to work in the same way. You can see a bit of what it's like on their website: https://elementary.io
Overall, I'd recommend this to someone who wants their computer to do simple tasks and stay out of the users way.
