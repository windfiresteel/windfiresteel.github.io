  I was just working late shift at the mall, when I heard a scream.  I knew that mall security is lazy and quits at 7pm, so since it's 11pm, I decided I should do something!  I hoped that my friend was delayed picking me up, I was scared now.  I closed shop and went towards the scream.  At this late hour the mall was basically empty.  When I found the source of the scream, it was as I feared.  Some weird guy in all black was chasing my friend with a knife.  I would've made a move, but then a young woman in jumpsuit kicked the freak in the face! I quickly grabbed my friend and found a spot to hide, and watch.  We were in for a very interesting fight.
            The pair started this battle with the same cold expression.  Then Shade, the bad guy as I named him,  started to smile.  It was a creepy smile.  His right hand started to glow and he attacked.  She dodged but her shoulder was hit, and then she confused me, she said "cold".  It was the middle of summer and the mall seemed pretty warm.  She retaliated with a swift kick to the --- Blocked! His hand glowing still he punched again, she blocked with her own punch this time.  Her hand seemed raw, yet she smiled.  As he was about to strike again, she places her foot on his chest, Then unbends her leg lightning fast! The push forced Shade back to the wall.  Flat on his back, he was out cold, or so I thought.  This fight was over... I looked for the hero, to thank her for saving our lives, but she was gone.
