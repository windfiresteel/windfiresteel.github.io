My name is John, and I'm not normal. I had a normal life before, and then I got a job. I became a demon hunter, that's my part time profession. How? I killed a demon, by accident. I was meeting old friends at a caf√©, and suddenly a strange blue creature appeared and attacked us. It was going to grab one of my friends, so I took the swiss army knife from my keys and cut at it's arm. I accidentally cut myself in the palm while doing this. We exchanged blood, his was so dark compared to his light colored skin. I looked him in the eyes, punched him in the nose, and he died. After that, I was approached by a woman who offered to pay me for getting rid of demons who caused problems. "I was never normal' I replied ' but now I'm supernatural."
