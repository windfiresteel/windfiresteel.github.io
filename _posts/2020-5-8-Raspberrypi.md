So, there's this little computer called a raspberry pi and there are a few variations for different purposes. Say you wanted to host your own email server or website, while any of themn could do it I think the one you'd want is the 3 a. If you, like me, like playing old video games in emulators you might want what I have which is the 3 b. Honestly I was just trying to see if this would let me post this from my pi. probably not.
