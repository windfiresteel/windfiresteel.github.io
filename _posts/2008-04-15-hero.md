She was on fire!  Feeling both excited and exhausted. She was trying to sleep off her first night as a hero!  She couldn't believe she beat the bad guy and saved her best friend.  She tried hard to sleep, but she was too happy to stay still.  Would it be on the news?  Then, she thought back to her fight, and her bizarre enemy.  After a while, she was lulled to sleep.  She knew tomorrow would be fun, seeing her friends at school.
