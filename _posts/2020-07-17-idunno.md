I have no idea what I'm doing, just kinda typing until it becomes something. I've been using an iPhone SE (2nd) for about a month or so now and I like it alot. I've never actually had an iPhone of my own but I've used an old iPad and borrowed and iPod touch before so. iOS is still as frustrating as it was before with little ways to customize it. The camera isn't as good as my older android phone, and no headphone jack means I have to use a wireless charger to charge and listen at the same time. On the plus side, I can use wireless chargers! It's amazing how much storage this phone has and finally my device can actually run games, like Minecraft, Fortnite, and I tried out Apple Arcade.. that was alright. The battery seems to drain really quickly but I can also charge it faster than I could charge my android phone? Overall I don't regret choosing to get a phone that I won't HAVE to replace within 2 or 3 years for security.
