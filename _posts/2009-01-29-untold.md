The stars could be seen through the over-hanging branches of the trees. The moon was full and brightly shining in my eyes. It was so beautiful, but scary at the same time. What appeared to be two red.. glowing.. eyes seemed to peer out of the darkness, not helping my unease. I decided to stay still and wait for them to move until.. A bolt of lightning revealed my friend's face. As he stepped forward, the moon lit him up so I could clearly see  that something was wrong. Then he fell, a knife in his back. I quickly grabbed my cell and called her, the local detective. She would know what to do, but there was no answer. There was just ringing and ringing. I heard a gunshot! My hand instinctively slammed on the alarm clock. I sat up in bed, in a cold sweat. Damn it! Time to go to school.
