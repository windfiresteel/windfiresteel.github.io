There is a very cold chill tonight, the campfire lightly *cackles* at my shivering. The mocha helps stave off my need to sleep, after all, I didn't come out all this way to miss the **comet**. Just *one* more hour as the winds growled. Just *thirty* minutes as the fire went dim. Just a bit longer as I take my last sip and the my mind slows... down. I close my eyes for a bit, and see it light up the sky.
